# Code Quiz (Challenge 4)
## About
This is a simple, four-question quiz made for a weekly assignment/challenge. It uses vanilla JavaScript, CSS, and html to display an array of questions with corresponding answer choices, rendered as buttons, along with a timer counting down from 60 seconds. 

Unfortunately, due to difficulties getting my `endQuiz()` function to trigger once the last question has been answered, the quiz can only be ended by clicking the 'End Quiz' button, which is always visible on the page. This is due to issues with disabling/enabling and/or changing the visibility of the button.

## Installation & Use
Visit the deployed app on [GitHub Pages](https://sar-kat-hop.github.io/code-quiz-c4/).

Please note that to end the quiz and enter your name/initials and save your score to local storage, you must click the 'End Quiz' button. This button is enabled from the start, so you can end the quiz at any point.
